# My Solutions Readme

I'm currently taking **Dockyard Academy Cirriculm** as a self-led software developer. This Repo is to document my solutions as I progress through the course in hopes of helping others going down the same road. Just like Brooklyn and Dockyard are helping those behind them up the ladder, I hope this helps those behind me.

## Notes to Self
- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

## Future Installments

- [x] LiveBook Install on Mac

  - Straight forward. Not sure where, but heard of [asdf as a package manager](https://asdf-vm.com/) and used it prior to installing Erlang or Elixir. Figured why not add more complexity to this self-taught process, but I figure going down the route of software developer keeping verisons seperate is important.

- [ ] Git Setup
  - Github login made
  - Repo Started
  - Figuring out the *"Main"* versus *"Solutions"* for local devolping on my computer to track progress.
