# My Solutions Readme

I'm currently taking **Dockyard Academy Cirriculm** as a self-led software developer. This Repo is to document my solutions as I progress through the course in hopes of helping others going down the same road. Just like Brooklyn and Dockyard are helping those behind them up the ladder, I hope this helps those behind me.

## Notes to Self
- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

## Future Installments

- [x] LiveBook Install on Mac

  - Straight forward. Not sure where, but heard of [asdf as a package manager](https://asdf-vm.com/) and used it prior to installing Erlang or Elixir. Figured why not add more complexity to this self-taught process, but I figure going down the route of software developer keeping verisons seperate is important.

- [ ] Git Setup
  - Github login made
  - Repo Started
  
**The Rabbit-Hole Begins**  

This feels like a "time-suck" but I also understand this is something I'm going to have to master as it's "table-stakes" for being a software engineer. Keep telling myself that this is like any computer game mostly a console game (**pun intended**), where it's just beating levels till the end and to enjoy the progress. 

  - Figuring out the *"Main"* versus *"Solutions"* for local devolping on my computer to track progress. 
  - Command for resetting your *Origin* so you can properly pull updates from the correct Git Repo and not your Soltuion's Repo
    - `` git remote set-url origin https://github.com/DockYard-Academy/curriculum.git ``
  - Set my repo for Solutions branch
   - ``git remote add upstream  https://github.com/TheGriffinCircus/dockyard-academy-solutions.git``
  - Sitting here, banging my head on the table. Hoping for *"AH-HA Moment"* and it' not coming, this needs to be simplier for self-led.
    - Choosing to skip for now and revisit.
    - IS this the solution??? - ``git push upstream command-line-reading`` Will have to revisit, this?
    - Setup SSH or personal token for access.[Further reading and reference from Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls)
